* A button in the fuel map editor page for autotune based on CSV datalog
* Opens a new window with file selection and configuration settings
* Reads a CSV file with at least TPS, IAP, RPM, AFR and Selected Map information
* Analyzes the CSV file, and generates correction suggestions based on the following configuration:
** Required samples per correction (i.e. TPS/RPM slot), i.e. at least 50 hits in the TPS/RPM slot
** Target AFR table for RPM/TPS and RPM/IAP
** Minimum correction (don't do corrections when they are smaller than this), i.e. 0,2% change
*** Avoids confusing the user with useless changes
** Maximum correction (limit corrections to this value even when it looks like we should correct more), i.e. 5%

* Corrections are always split between 4 cells based on the following algorithm:
** Find two RPM slots where rpm >= lower_rpm and rpm < higher_rpm
** rpm_range = higher_rpm - lower_rpm
** rpm_val = higher_rpm - rpm
** rpm_relative = rpm_val / rpm_range   // rpm relative %
** rpm_lower_percent = rpm_relative	// how many % of correction goes to the lower rpm
** rpm_higher_percent = 1 - rpm_relative	//how many % of correction goes to the higher rpm

** Similar algorithm for splitting correction between IAP slots, when on IAP map
** Similar algorithm for splitting correction between TPS slots, when on TPS map

** Correction calculation:
*** i.e. real_afr = 15.0, target_afr = 14.5
*** correction_relative = (real_afr - target_afr) / real_afr
*** i.e. (15.0 - 14.5) / 15.0 = ~0.033 = 3.3% --> make 3.3% richer
*** that 3.3% is split between 4 cells based on the previous split algorithm, i.e.
*** rpm = 3750
*** lower_rpm = 3000
*** higher_rpm = 4000
*** tps = 17.5%
*** lower_tps = 15%
*** higher_rps = 20
*** tps_relative = 50%
*** rpm_relative = 50%
*** --> split that 3.3% as 25%/25%/25%/25% = each cell goes 0.825% richer
